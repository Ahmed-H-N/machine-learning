In the first part of this program, we'll cover the main algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as the main techniques for making your models work well. In the first section called Model evaluation and validation, you will learn what machine learning models are and how to train them, test them and validate them. You will learn the main problems one has to deal with when training a model, such as: over fitting and under fitting. And you'll be able to measure them and improve your training. Most algorithms of machine learning fall into two categories, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is comprised of all the algorithms which will predict a label. We'll go deep into the algorithms of supervised learning such a decision trees, logistic regression, support Vector machines, Naive Bayes and neural networks. In the next section, you will be learning the main unsupervised learning algorithms, especially those involving clustering and dimensionality reduction. These are useful when our data comes with no labels and we need to find properties about it. You'll be able to apply these algorithms on real data sets as well. In the second part of the nanodegree program, you will go much deeper into cutting edge topics in machine learning, such as; Deep learning and reinforcement learning. Neural networks have been crucial in most of the recent advances in machine learning including Alpha go, IBM Watson and self driving cars. In the next section, you'll get a solid foundation of deep neural networks. You'll also learn convolutional neural networks use from many applications, but in particular, for image recognition. Reinforcement learning is an interesting form of machine learning where do you train an intelligent agent to perform actions in an environment, Instead of predicting labels or values. You'll get to use state of the art platforms, like open the EyeGym and cutting edge deep reinforcement learning algorithms like deep Q-networks to solve challenging problems. After completing this program, you'll have a solid foundation in the main algorithms used in machine learning today. See you in class.
