    "- Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may a↵ect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics—**trial-and-error** search and **delayed reward**—are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning, like many topics whose names end with “ing,” such as machine learning and mountaineering, is simultaneously a (1) problem, (2) a class of solution methods that work well on the problem, and (3) the field that studies this problem and its solution methods. It is convenient to use a single name for all three things, but at the same time essential to keep the three conceptually separate. \n",
    "    - **In particular, the distinction between problems and solution methods is very important in reinforcement learning; failing to make this distinction is the source of many confusions.** <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- We formalize the problem of reinforcement learning using ideas from **dynamical systems theory**, specifically, as the optimal control of incompletely-known Markov decision processes. The details of this formalization must wait until Chapter 3, but the basic idea is simply to capture the most important aspects of the real problem facing a learning agent interacting over time with its environment to achieve a goal. A learning agent must be able to **sense** the state of its environment to some extent and must be able to **take actions** that affect the state. The agent also must **have a goal or goals** relating to the state of the environment. \n",
    "- **Markov decision processes are intended to include just these three aspects—sensation, action, and goal—**in their simplest possible forms without trivializing any of them. \n",
    "- Any method that is well suited to solving such problems we consider to be a reinforcement learning method. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- look at [page 24] to see how RL is different from Suprevised and unsupervised learning... <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the challenges that arise in reinforcement learning, and not in other kinds of learning, is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "    - The agent must try a variety of actions and progressively favor those that appear to be best. On a stochastic task, each action must be tried many times to gain a reliable estimate of its expected reward.\n",
    "- Another key feature of reinforcement learning is that it explicitly considers the whole problem of a goal-directed agent interacting with an uncertain environment. This is in contrast to many approaches that consider subproblems without addressing how they might fit into a larger picture. Although these approaches have yielded many useful results, their focus on isolated subproblems is a significant limitation. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most exciting aspects of modern reinforcement learning is its substantive and fruitful interactions with other engineering and scientific disciplines. Reinforcement learning is part of a decades-long trend within artificial intelligence and machine learning toward greater integration with statistics, optimization, and other mathematical subjects. For example, the ability of some reinforcement learning methods to learn with parameterized approximators addresses the classical “curse of dimensionality” in operations research and control theory. More distinctively, reinforcement learning has also interacted strongly with psychology and neuroscience, with substantial benefits going both ways. Of all the forms of machine learning, reinforcement learning is the closest to the kind of learning that humans and other animals do, and many of the core algorithms of reinforcement learning were originally inspired by biological learning systems. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, reinforcement learning is also part of a larger trend in artificial intelligence back toward simple general principles.\n",
    "    - Modern artificial intelligence now includes much research looking for general principles of learning, search, and decision making. It is not clear how far back the pendulum will swing, but reinforcement learning research is certainly part of the swing back toward simpler and fewer general principles of artificial intelligence. <br><br>\n",

    "**1.3 elements of RL** <br>\n",
    "- Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements of a reinforcement learning system: (1) a policy, (2) a reward signal, (3) a value function, and, optionally, (4) a model of the environment.\n",
    "    - (1) **policy**\n",
    "        - defines the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time. Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.\n",
    "        -  In some cases the policy may be a simple function or lookup table, whereas in others it may involve extensive computation such as a search process. \n",
    "        - The policy is the core of a reinforcement learning agent in the sense that it alone is sufficient to determine behavior. \n",
    "        - In general, policies may be stochastic, specifying probabilities for each action.\n",
    "    - (2) **reward signal**\n",
    "        - defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem. \n",
    "        - On each time step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a single number called the reward. \n",
    "        - The agent’s sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run. The reward signal thus defines what are the good and bad events for the agent.\n",
    "        - The reward signal is the primary basis for altering the policy; if an action selected by the policy is followed by low reward, then the policy may be changed to select some other action in that situation in the future. \n",
    "        - In general, reward signals may be stochastic functions of the state of the environment and the actions taken.\n",
    "    - (3) **value function**\n",
    "        - Whereas the **reward signal** indicates what is good in an immediate sense, a **value function** specifies what is good in the long run. \n",
    "        - Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state.\n",
    "        - Whereas rewards determine the immediate, intrinsic desirability of environmental states, values indicate the long-term desirability of states after taking into account the states that are likely to follow and the rewards available in those states. \n",
    "        - For example, a state might always yield a low immediate reward but still have a high value because it is regularly followed by other states that yield high rewards. Or the reverse could be true.\n",
    "        - Rewards are in a sense primary, whereas values, as predictions of rewards, are secondary. Without rewards there could be no values, and the only purpose of estimating values is to achieve more reward. Nevertheless, it is values with which we are most concerned when making and evaluating decisions. Action choices are made based on value judgments. We seek actions that bring about states of highest value, not highest reward, because these actions obtain the greatest amount of reward for us over the long run.\n",
    "        - <u> Unfortunately, it is much harder to determine values than it is to determine rewards. Rewards are basically given directly by the environment, but values must be estimated and re-estimated from the sequences of observations an agent makes over its entire lifetime. In fact, the most important component of almost all reinforcement learning algorithms we consider is a method for efficiently estimating values. </u> The central role of value estimation is arguably the most important thing that has been learned about reinforcement learning over the last six decades.\n",
    "    - (4) **model of the environment**\n",
    "        - This is something that mimics the behavior of the environment, or more generally, that allows inferences to be made about how the environment will behave. For example, given a state and action, the model might predict the resultant next state and next reward. \n",
    "        - Models are used for **planning**, by which we mean any way of deciding on a course of action by considering possible future situations before they are actually experienced. \n",
    "        - Methods for solving reinforcement learning problems that use *models and planning* are called **model-based** methods, as opposed to simpler **model-free** methods that are explicitly *trial-and-error* learners—viewed as almost the **opposite** of planning. \n",
    "        - In Chapter 8 we explore reinforcement learning systems that simultaneously learn by trial and error, learn a model of the environment, and use the model for planning. Modern reinforcement learning spans the spectrum from low-level, trial-and-error learning to high-level, deliberative planning.\n",
    "        \n",
    "**1.4 Limitaion and Scope** <br>        \n",
    "- We do not address the issues of constructing, changing, or learning the state signal in this book (other than briefly in  ection 17.3). We take this approach not because we consider state representation to be unimportant, but in order to focus fully on the decision-making issues. In other words, our concern in this book is not with designing the state signal, but with deciding what action to take as a function of whatever state signal is available.\n",
    "- Most of the reinforcement learning methods we consider in this book are structured around estimating value functions, but it is not strictly necessary to do this to solve reinforcement learning problems. For example, solution methods such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, simulated annealing, and other optimization methods never estimate value functions. These methods apply multiple static policies each interacting over an extended period of time with a separate instance of the environment. The policies that obtain the most reward, and random variations of them, are carried over to the next generation of policies, and the process repeats. We call these evolutionary methods because their operation is analogous to the way biological evolution produces organisms with skilled behavior even if they do not learn during their individual lifetimes. If the space of policies is sufficiently small, or can be structured so that good policies are\n",
    "- common or easy to find—or if a lot of time is available for the search—then evolutionary methods can be e↵ective. In addition, evolutionary methods have advantages on problems in which the learning agent cannot sense the complete state of its environment.\n",
    "- Our focus is on reinforcement learning methods that learn while interacting with the environment, which evolutionary methods do not do. Methods able to take advantage of the details of individual behavioral interactions can be much more efficient than evolutionary methods in many cases. Evolutionary methods ignore much of the useful structure of the reinforcement learning problem: they do not use the fact that the policy they are searching for is a function from states to actions; they do not notice which states an individual passes through during its lifetime, or which actions it selects. In some cases this information can be misleading (e.g., when states are misperceived), but more often it should enable more efficient search. Although evolution and learning share many features and naturally work together, we do not consider evolutionary methods by themselves to be especially well suited to reinforcement learning problems and, accordingly, we do not cover them in this book.\n",

    "- The RL framework is characterized by an agent learned to interact with its environment. (fig.1) \n",
    "    - We assume that time evolves and discrete timesteps.\n",
    "    - At the initial timestep,the agent observes the environment. (fig.2)\n",
    "    - You can think of this observation as a situation that the environment presents to the agent.\n",
    "    - Then, it (the agent) must select an appropriate action in response. (fig.3)\n",
    "    - Then at the next timestep in response to the agents action, the environment presents a new situation to the agent. (fig.4).  At the same time the environment gives the agent a reward which provides some indication of whether the agent has responded appropriately to the environment. (fig.5)\n",
    "    - Then the process continues where at each timestep the environment sends the agent an observation and reward (fig.6). And in response, the agent must choose an action. (fig.7) <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In general, we don't need to assume that the environment shows the agent everything he needs to make well-informed decisions. But it greatly simplifies the underlying mathematics if we do. So in this course, we'll make the assumption that the agent is able to fully observe what ever state the environment is in. And instead of referring to the agent as receiving an observation, we will hence say that it receives the environment state. (fig.8 where \"observation\" is changed to \"state\"). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- But let's make this description a bit clearer with some added notation where we again start from the very beginning at timestep zero.\n",
    "    - The agent first receives the environment state which we denote by S0, where zero stands for a timestep zero of course. (fig.9)\n",
    "    - Then, based on that observation the agent chooses an action, A0 (fig.10). \n",
    "    - At the next timestep, in this case, at timestep one, and as a direct consequence of the agent's choice of action, A0, and the environments previous state, S0, the environment transitions to a new state, S1, and gives some reward, R1, to the agent. (fig.11)\n",
    "    - The agent then chooses an action, A1. (fig.12 where A0 is changed to A1 inside the square, and A1 is added at the far right)\n",
    "    - At timestep two, the process continues where the environment passes the reward in state, then the agent responds with an action (fig.13) and so on. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Whereas the agent interacts with the environment, this interaction is manifest as a sequence of states, actions, and rewards. That said, the reward will always be the most relevant quantity to the agent. To be specific, any agent has the goal to  aximize expected cumulative reward or the some of the rewards attained over all timesteps. In other words, it seeks to find the  trategy for choosing actions with the cumulative reward is likely to be quite high. And the agent can only accomplish this by  nteracting with the environment. This is because at every timestep, the environment decides how much reward the agent receives. In other words, the agent must play by the rules of the environment. But through interaction, the agent can learn those rules  nd choose appropriate actions to accomplish its goal. And this is essentially what we'll try to accomplish in this course. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- But it's important to emphasize that all of this is just a mathematical model for a real world problem. **So if you have a  roblem in mind that you think can be solved with reinforcement learning, you will have to specify the states, actions, and rewards, and you'll have to decide the rules of the environment**. \n",
    "- In this course. You'll see a lot of examples for how to accomplish this.\n",

In fact, this rewards function is so simple that it may seem that deciding reward is quite straightforward, but in general, this is not the case. Of course, there are some counterexamples to this. For instance, if you're teaching an agent to play a video game, the reward is just the score on the screen. And if you're teaching an agent to play Backgammon, well, the reward is delivered only at the end of the game, and you could construct it to be positive if the agent wins, and negative, if it loses.\n",

    "- Built into the framework is the agent's goal which is to maximize cumulative reward.But what exactly does this mean and how does the agent accomplish this?\n",
    "- Could the agent just maximize the reward and each time step? The short answer to that question is, no. But I think a long answer would be a lot more satisfying. So let's try to understand this with the walking robot example.\n",
    "- Remember that in this case, the goal of the robot was to stay walking forward (first three terms) for as long (last term) and as quickly (first term) as possible while also exerting minimal effort (4th term, that let the robot walk smoothly).\n",
    "    - In this case, if the robot tried to maximize the reward it received at a single time step, that would look like trying to move as quickly as possible with as little effort without falling immediately. That could work well in the short term but it's possible, for instance, that the agents movement gets it moving quickly without falling initially. But that first movement was de-stabilising enough that it doomed the agent to fall in a short time. In this way, if the agent focused on individual time steps, it could learn actions that maximize initial rewards. But then the episode terminates quite quickly. And so the cumulative reward is quite small. And still worse, in this case, the agent will not have learned to walk. In this example then, it's clear that the agent cannot focus on individual time steps and instead, needs to keep all time steps in mind. But this also holds true for reinforcement learning agents in general. **Actions have short and long term consequences and the agent needs to gain some understanding of the complex effects its actions have on the environment.**\n",
    "    - Along these lines in the walking robot example, if the agent always has reward at all time steps in mind, it will learn to choose movement designed for long term stability. So in this way, the robot moves a bit slowly to sacrifice a little bit of reward but it will payoff because it will avoid falling for longer and collect higher cumulative reward. \n",
    "    - But now, what does all of this mean when the agent chooses an action at an arbitrary time step? How exactly does it keep all time steps in mind? Well, if we're looking at some time step, t, it's important to note that the rewards for all previous time steps have already been decided as they're in the past. Only future rewards are inside the agent's control (fig.1). We refer to the sum of rewards from the next time step onward as the **return** and denote it with a **capital G** (fig.2), and at an arbitrary time step, the agent will always choose an action towards the goal of maximizing the *return*. But it's actually more accurate to say that the agent seeks to maximize **expected return**. This is because it's generally the case that the agent can't predict with complete certainty what the future reward is likely to be. So it has to rely on a prediction or an estimate.\n",

    "- We've discussed how an agent might choose actions with the goal of maximizing expected return but we need to dig a bit deeper. For instance, consider our puppy agent, how does he predict how much reward he could get at any point in the future?Puppies can live for decades. Can he really be expected to have just as much of an idea of how much reward he'll get now as he does five years from now? Does it make more sense to consider that it's not entirely clear what the future holds especially if the puppy is still learning, proposing, and testing hypotheses and changing his strategy? It's unlikely that he'll know one thousand times steps in advance what his reward potential is likely to be. In general, the puppy is likely to have a much better idea of what's likely to happen in the near future than he does for a distant time points. Along these lines then, should present reward carry the same weight as future reward? Maybe it makes more sense to value rewards that come sooner more highly, since those rewards are more predictable. This situation motivates the idea of discounting and discounted return. <br><br>\n",

And currently, each time step from $t+1$ onward has an equal say in how the agent should make decisions. What if instead, we wanted time steps that occurred earlier in time to have a much greater say. Well, then instead of maximizing this sum, the idea is that we'll maximize a different sum with rewards that are farther along in time are multiplied by smaller values. We refer to this sum as discounted return. By discounted, we mean that we'll change the goal to care more about immediate rewards rather than rewards that are received further in the future. (fig.1) <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- But how do we choose what values to use here? Well, in practice, we'll define what's called a discount rate, which is always denoted by the Greek letter gamma, and is always a number between zero and one. Then, as for the values, the first term is multiplied by gamma. The second term is multiplied by gamma square. Then, gamma to the third power and so on (fig.2). In this way, we have a nice decay where rewards that occur earlier in time are always multiplied by a larger number. <br><br>\n",

    "- It's **important to note that this gamma is not something that's learned by the agent**. It's something that you set to refine the goal that you have for the agent. So how exactly might you set the value of gamma?  <br>\n",
    "Let's begin by looking at what happens when we set gamma to one. So we plug in one everywhere we see gamma and we see it yields the original, completely un-discounted return from the previous videos. And what about when gamma is set to zero? In this case, every term in this sum disappears with the exception of the most immediate reward (fig.3). \n",
    "- In this way, we see that the larger you make gamma, the more the agent cares about the distant future. And as gamma gets smaller and smaller, we get increasingly extreme discounting, where in the most extreme case, the agent only cares about the most immediate reward.\n",
    "- It's **important to note that discounting is particularly relevant to continuing tasks.** Remember that a continuing task is one where the agent environment interaction goes on without end. In this case, if the agent wants to maximize cumulative reward while it's a pretty difficult task if the feature is limitless. So we use discounting to avoid having to look too far into the limitless future.\n",
    "- But it's **important to note that with or without discounting, the goal is always the same. It's always to maximize cumulative reward.**\n",
    "- The discount rate comes in when the agent chooses actions at an arbitrary time step. It uses the discount rate as part of its program for picking actions. And that program is more interested in securing rewards that come sooner and are more likely than the rewards that come later and are less likely.<br>\n",

We'll use the remainder of this lesson to specify a rigorous definition for the reinforcement learning problem. For context, we'll work with the example of a recycling robot from the Sutton textbook. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- So consider a robot that's designed for picking up empty soda cans. The robot is equipped with arms to grab the cans and runs on a rechargeable battery. There's a docking station set up in one corner of the room and the robot has to sit at the station if it needs to recharge its battery. Say, you're trying to program this robot to collect empty soda cans without human intervention. In particular, you want the robot to be able to decide for itself when it needs to recharge its battery. And whenever it doesn't need to recharge, you want it to focus on collecting as many soda cans as possible. **So let's see if we can frame this as a reinforcement learning problem.** <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll begin with the actions.\n",
    "- **Actions** :\n",
    "    - We'll say the robot is capable of executing three potential actions. It can search the room for cans, it can head to the docking station to recharge its battery, or it can stay put in the hopes that someone brings it a can. We refer to the set of possible actions as the action space, and it's common to denote it with a script A.\n",

    "    - Remember, the states are just the context provided to the agent for making intelligent actions. So the state, in this case, could be the charge left on the robot's battery. For simplicity, we'll assume that the battery has one of two states. One corresponding to a high amount of charge left, and the other corresponding to a low amount of charge. We refer to the set of possible states as the state space and it's common to denote with a script S. So intuition tells us that if the robot has a high amount of charge left on its battery, we'd like it to know to actively search for the room for cans. Searching the room should use up a lot of energy but this doesn't matter so much because the battery has a lot of charge anyway. But if the state is low, searching for cans has pretty high risk because the battery could get depleted mid-search and then the robot would be stranded and that wouldn't be so good because we don't want to have to come to its rescue. So if the battery is low, maybe we'd like the robot to know to wait for a can or to go to recharge its battery. \n",

    "    - Then, the robot could choose to search, wait, or recharge. But actually, recharging doesn't make much sense if the battery is already high, so we'll say that the only options are to search or wait. All right, so if the agent chooses to search, then at the next time step, the state could be high or low. Let's say that with 70 percent probability, it stays high. So there's a 30 percent chance the battery switches to low. In both cases, we'll say that this decision to search led to the robot collecting exactly four cans. And in line with this, the environment gives the agent a reward of four. The other option is to wait. If the robot has a high battery and then decides to wait, well, waiting doesn't use any battery at all and we'll say that then, it's guaranteed that the battery will again be high at the next time step. In this case, we'll suppose that since the robot wasn't out actively searching, it's able to collect fewer cans and say it's delivered just one can. And again in line with this, the environment gives the agent a reward of one. <br><br>\n",

    "    - Again, the robot has three options. If the battery is low and it chooses to wait for people to bring cans, that doesn't use any battery until the state at the next time step is going to be low. And just like when the robot decided to wait when the battery was high, the agent gets a reward of one. If the robot recharges, then it goes back to the docking station and the state of that the next time step is guaranteed to be high. Say it collects no cans along the way and gets a reward of zero. And if it searches, well, that's risky. It's possible that it gets away with this and then at the next time step, the battery is still low but not entirely depleted. But it's probably more likely that the robot depletes its battery, has to be rescued and is carried to a docking station to be charged. So the charge on its battery at the next time step is high. So the robot depletes its battery with 80 percent probability and otherwise gets away with that risky action with 20 percent probability. As for the reward, if the robot needs to be rescued, we want to make sure we're punishing the robot in this case, so say we don't look at all at the number of cans it was able to collect and we just give the robot a reward of negative three for that. But if the robot gets away with it, he collects four cans and get the reward of four. \n",

Then, the environment would flip a theoretical coin with 70 percent probability of landing heads, and if that coin landed heads, the environment would decide that the next state was high and the agent would get a reward four. Otherwise, if it landed tails, the next state would be low and the reward would be four. As another example, if the last state was low and the agent decided to search, the environment would again flip a theoretical coin now with 80 percent probability of landing heads.

And how well the agent is doing or how much reward it's collected has no effect on how the environment chooses to respond to the agent.

    "#### The Setting, Revisited\n",
    "- The reinforcement learning (RL) framework is characterized by an **agent** learning to interact with its **environment**.\n",
    "- At each time step, the agent receives the environment's **state** (the environment presents a situation to the agent), and the agent must choose an appropriate **action** in response. One time step later, the agent receives (1) a **reward** (the environment indicates whether the agent has responded appropriately to the state) and (2) a new **state**.\n",
    "- All agents have the goal to maximize expected **cumulative reward**, or the expected sum of rewards attained over all time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Episodic vs. Continuing Tasks\n",
    "- A **task** is an instance of the reinforcement learning (RL) problem.\n",
    "- **Continuing tasks** are tasks that continue forever, without end.\n",
    "- **Episodic tasks** are tasks with a well-defined starting and ending point.\n",
    "    - In this case, we refer to a complete sequence of interaction, from start to finish, as an **episode**.\n",
    "    - Episodic tasks come to an end whenever the agent reaches a **terminal state**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### The Reward Hypothesis\n",
    "- **Reward Hypothesis**: All goals can be framed as the maximization of (expected) cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals and Rewards\n",
    "- (Please see **Part 1** and **Part 2** (my note: i think he means 6-2.13 and 6-2.14) to review an example of how to specify the reward signal in a real-world problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cumulative Reward\n",
    "- The **return at time step** $t$ is $G_t := R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \\ldots$\n",
    "- The agent selects actions with the goal of maximizing expected (discounted) return. (Note: discounting is covered in the next concept.) (my note: i think, by \"next concept\" he means \"the next line\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discounted Return\n",
    "- The **discounted return at time step** $t$ is $G_t := R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\ldots$.\n",
    "- The discount rate $\\gamma$ is something that you set, to refine the goal that you have the agent.\n",
    "    - It must satisfy $0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    - If $\\gamma=0$, the agent only cares about the most immediate reward.\n",
