    "### (1-2.2) About Pytorch and this lesson\n",
    "Welcome! In this lesson, you'll learn how to use PyTorch for building deep learning models. PyTorch was released in early 2017 and has been making a pretty big impact in the deep learning community. It's developed as an open source project by the [Facebook AI Research team](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/), but is being adopted by teams everywhere in industry and academia. In my experience, it's the best framework for learning deep learning and just a delight to work with in general. By the end of this lesson, you'll have trained your own deep learning model that can classify images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll first give you a basic introduction to PyTorch, where we'll cover **tensors** - the main data structure of PyTorch. I'll show you how to create tensors, how to do simple operations, and how tensors interact with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you'll learn about a module called **autograd** that PyTorch uses to calculate gradients for training neural networks. Autograd, in my opinion, is amazing. It does all the work of backpropagation for you by calculating the gradients at each operation in the network which you can then use to update the network weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll use PyTorch to build a network and run data forward through it. After that, you'll define a loss and an optimization method to train the neural network on a dataset of handwritten digits. You'll also learn how to test that your network is able to generalize through **validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you'll find that your network doesn't work too well with more complex images. You'll learn how to use pre-trained networks to improve the performance of your classifier, a technique known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along with the videos and work through the exercises in your own notebooks. If you get stuck, check out my solution videos and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part of the series has a soft requirement of a GPU used to accelerate network computations. Even if you don't have a GPU available, you'll still be able to run the code and finish the exercises. PyTorch uses a library called [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) to accelerate operations using the GPU. If you have a GPU that CUDA supports, you'll be able to install all the necessary libraries by installing PyTorch with conda. If you can't use a local GPU, you can use cloud platforms such as [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/gpu.html), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gpu/), and [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) to train your networks on a GPU.\n",

Feel free to check out our solutions both in the videos and in the solution notebooks, but remember that it's super important that you **type in the correct code yourself**. If you want to learn how to do this, you have to write in the code yourself, understand what every line of the code is doing, and get everything to work properly yourself.
