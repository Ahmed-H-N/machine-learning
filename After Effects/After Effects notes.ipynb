    "- when you draw a shape, if u draw it by mouse, its anchor will not be in the shapes center (which will force u to adjust it), but u can avoid that by double clicking on the shape tool, this will make the shape as larga as the video, but it will also make the anchot at the center of the shape (and then u can resize the shape as u want)\n",
    "- here are the steps of making circular burst :\n",
    "    - 1) double click on the rounded rectangle tool \n",

    "                - remove the `position` vlaue by setting it to all zeros\n",
    "                - at `rotation` write the following 0x 360/13 , and the program will make the math for you\n",
    "    - 5) reposition the shape layer\n",
    "        - its hard to move it by hand, so you may use the `position` attribute at the shape layer \n",
    "            - this is done by : shape layer -> transform -> position (careful not to go under content (which has \"rectangle 1\" and \"repeater 1\") because u may find transform there, but it is not the intended to be changed )\n",

    "        - hold **`alt`** and click on the watch that is on the left of the `scale` attr\n",

    "    - to apply this to our icon \n",
